## Key Insights & Recommendations

### üí° Strategic Findings

1. **Software-Based Model Dominance**
   - Generates 2-3x higher revenue across all facility sizes
   - Revenue advantage decreases as facility size increases
   - Most profitable for 100-200 camera deployments

2. **Server Type Performance**
   - type_12 servers consistently outperform type_16 in revenue generation
   - type_16 servers require fewer units but have higher hardware costs
   - type_12 offers better ROI despite requiring more servers

3. **Scalability Economics**
   - Software-based pricing shows diminishing returns at scale
   - Feature-based pricing provides consistent margins
   - Crossover point suggests hybrid pricing strategy potential
